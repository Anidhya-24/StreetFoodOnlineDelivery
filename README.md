• It is a web based application which is going to provide an online platform for customers to order street food.

If we talk about existing system then we sure that many of the food delivery websites are there in market. 
But most of the websites are associated with a particular food corner. 
These are not small food corners these are well known market giants. Existing system are running in various big cities.
So to overcome this problem we introduced this 
There are basically 3 users in this system, which are..
1)	Customer/user
2)	Foodcorner
3)	Admin
   
   ADMIN: 
	Admin has the main account for managing whole website. 
	Admin can add Food Corner, & locations.
	Admin check the registered users and the order they placed. 
	Admin can review suggestion or request from food corner or customer.
